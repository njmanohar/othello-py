This plays the game of othello using an arbitrary depth
minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning and a simple
evaluation function. The code comes with an evaluation function
and a GUI to play the game against the computer. You can
modify the evaluation function to try out different strategies.
The game and GUI is written entirely in python.

If you manage to beat version 0.2 (with the new evaluation function)
please send me an email with the full console output of the game.
